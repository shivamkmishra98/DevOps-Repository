# **Cloud Computing Cheat Sheet**

## **1. Introduction**

**Cloud Computing** is the delivery of computing services (servers, storage, networking, databases, analytics, software) over the internet on a pay-as-you-go model.

### **Key Characteristics**

* On-demand self-service
* Broad network access
* Resource pooling
* Rapid elasticity and scalability
* Measured service (pay-per-use)
* High availability and reliability
* Multi-tenancy

# **2. Service Models**

## **IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service**

* Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet
* You manage: OS, apps, runtime, data
* Provider manages: hardware, networking, virtualization
  **Examples:** AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs

## **PaaS – Platform as a Service**

* Provides hardware + software tools for application development
* You manage: applications, data
* Provider manages: OS, middleware, runtime
  **Examples:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Azure App Service

## **SaaS – Software as a Service**

* Fully managed applications delivered via browser
* You manage: only usage
* Provider manages everything
  **Examples:** Gmail, Slack, Office 365

# **3. Deployment Models**

## **Public Cloud**

Owned and operated by third-party providers; resources shared among users.

## **Private Cloud**

Dedicated infrastructure for one organization; more control and security.

## **Hybrid Cloud**

Combination of public + private; enables workload portability.

## **Community Cloud**

Shared by organizations with common interests (security, compliance, mission).

# **4. Cloud Architecture Components**

* **Client Layer:** Browsers, apps
* **Application Layer:** SaaS apps, APIs
* **Platform Layer:** Runtime, databases, middleware
* **Infrastructure Layer:** Compute (VMs, containers), storage, network
* **Virtualization Layer:** Hypervisors, container engines
* **Physical Layer:** Servers, storage, data centers

---

# **5. Virtualization**

### **Definition**

Technology that creates virtual versions of hardware, storage, networks.

### **Types**

* Hardware Virtualization
* OS-level Virtualization (Containers)
* Network Virtualization
* Storage Virtualization

### **Hypervisors**

* **Type 1 (Bare Metal):** Xen, VMware ESXi, Hyper-V
* **Type 2 (Hosted):** VirtualBox, VMware Workstation

---

# **6. Containers & Microservices**

* Containers use OS-level virtualization
* Lightweight, portable, fast
* Microservices architecture splits applications into loosely coupled services

**Tools:** Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, Helm

---

# **7. Cloud Storage Types**

* **Object Storage:** S3, Azure Blob, GCP Cloud Storage
* **Block Storage:** EBS, Persistent Disk
* **File Storage:** EFS, Azure Files
* **Cold/Archive Storage:** Glacier

---

# **8. Networking in Cloud**

* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
* Subnets (Public/Private)
* Internet Gateway
* NAT Gateway
* Load Balancers (L4, L7)
* DNS Services
* CDN (Content Delivery Network)

---

# **9. Security in Cloud**

### **Shared Responsibility Model**

* Cloud provider: Security *of* the cloud
* Customer: Security *in* the cloud

### **Key Security Concepts**

* IAM (Identity and Access Management)
* Encryption (at rest, in transit)
* Firewalls & Security Groups
* Compliance (ISO, GDPR, HIPAA)
* Key Management Services

---

# **10. Cloud Scalability & Performance**

* **Vertical Scaling:** Increase resources of one server
* **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more servers
* **Auto-scaling:** Automatic adjustment of capacity
* **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across servers
* **Caching:** Reduce data fetch time

---

# **11. Cloud Service Billing**

### **Billing Models**

* Pay-as-you-go
* Reserved instances
* Spot instances
* Subscription plans

### **Cost Optimization**

* Right-sizing
* Auto-scaling
* Using serverless
* Storage lifecycle policies

---

# **12. Serverless Computing**

* No server provisioning
* Event-driven
* Automatically scales
* Pay only for usage
  **Examples:** AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions

---

# **13. Cloud Management Tools**

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, CloudFormation
* **Monitoring:** CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Stackdriver
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI
